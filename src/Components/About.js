              <h1>About Me</h1>
              <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I'm a learning web-developer. I have always been passionate about computers and decided to turn that passion into a career. 
                Though my experience in the industry is minimal, I have honed my skils and gained valuable knowledge and experties. 
                My main focus is on building interactive websites and I am constantly striving to learn more and improve my craft. 
                In additional to my professional work, I also enjoy photopgraphy and music. I find that these activities help to keep me balanced and energized, 
                which ultimately benefits my wok as well.</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I created this website as a way to showcase my work and provide a platform for 
                  others to learn more about me and what I do. I believe that collaboration and communication
                  are key to success, and I am always open to new opportunities and partnerships.
